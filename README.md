# Meal-Nomeal-Classificiation
Implementing a meal no-meal detection classifier 

    Data : Continuous glucose monitor output for every 5 mins over a period of 2.5 hours for 5 different people. Data is labelled whether meal or no-meal
Feature extraction :
  1. Entropy
  2. Polynomial Fit coeffecients of time series
  3. CGM Acceleration 
  4. Mean-value crossing 
  5. DWT
  
Classification models trained :
  1. Decision Tree
  2. Random Forests
  3. Gradient-Boost
